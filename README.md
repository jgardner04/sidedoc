# Sidedoc

An AI-native document format that separates content from formatting, enabling efficient AI interaction with documents while preserving rich formatting for human consumption.

**Status:** ✅ MVP Complete - All features implemented and tested

## The Problem

Current document workflows force a tradeoff between AI efficiency and human usability:

1. **Reading documents:** Tools like Document Intelligence extract content for AI reasoning, but this is expensive (high token cost for XML parsing) and loses the connection to the original formatting.

2. **Creating documents:** Tools like Pandoc generate docx from markdown, but this is one-way—there's no maintained link between the AI-friendly representation and the formatted output.

3. **Iterative collaboration:** When AI and humans work on the same document over time, the current model requires repeated extraction and regeneration, which is lossy and expensive.

## Why Sidedoc?

### The Token Efficiency Problem

When AI reads a 10-page Word document:
- **Via Document Intelligence/XML:** 15,000+ tokens (includes XML structure, formatting metadata, schema definitions)
- **Via Sidedoc markdown:** 1,500 tokens (clean content only)

**Result:** 10x cost reduction and faster processing for AI workflows.

For a team processing 100 documents per day, this translates to:
- **Cost savings:** 90% reduction in AI API costs for document reading
- **Speed improvement:** 5-10x faster document processing
- **Context efficiency:** Fit more documents in a single AI context window

### The Lossless Iteration Problem

**Current workflow:**
1. Extract .docx → AI reads XML/text (expensive, slow)
2. AI generates new content
3. Generate new .docx → Formatting details lost or manually reapplied
4. Repeat → Each cycle degrades formatting fidelity

**Sidedoc workflow:**
1. Extract .docx once → Creates .sidedoc with separated content and formatting
2. AI reads markdown (cheap, fast)
3. AI edits markdown
4. Sync → Formatting automatically reapplied from preserved metadata
5. Repeat infinitely → Zero formatting degradation

### Real-World Use Case: Quarterly Report Automation

**Scenario:** Your company has a formatted quarterly report template with logos, custom styles, and corporate branding.

**Traditional approach:**
- Extract content → AI updates with new data → Generate new docx
- Problem: Lose custom formatting, manual reformatting required each quarter
- Cost: High token usage + human time for reformatting

**Sidedoc approach:**
1. Extract company template to `.sidedoc` (once)
2. AI reads markdown (90% fewer tokens), updates with Q2 data
3. Sync changes back - formatting, headers, logos all intact
4. Stakeholders receive familiar, properly formatted Word document
5. Next quarter: Repeat steps 2-4 (no reformatting needed)

## The Solution

Documents should have two representations that stay in sync:

- **Markdown** — optimized for AI (efficient to read/write, low token cost)
- **Formatted docx** — optimized for humans (rich formatting, familiar tools)

Changes to either should propagate to the other. Sidedoc makes this possible.

### Sidedoc vs. Alternatives

| Approach | AI Token Cost | Format Preservation | Iteration Support | Human Usability |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Direct .docx** | 🔴 Very High (XML) | N/A | 🔴 Poor | ✅ Excellent |
| **Document Intelligence** | 🔴 Very High | 🔴 Lost | 🔴 None | ❌ No output format |
| **Pandoc (md→docx)** | ✅ Low | 🔴 Lost | 🔴 One-way only | ⚠️ Basic styling |
| **Sidedoc** | ✅ Low | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Lossless | ✅ Excellent |

**Key Insight:** Sidedoc is the only approach that combines low AI token costs with perfect format preservation and lossless iteration, while maintaining full human usability through standard Word documents.

## How It Works

A `.sidedoc` file is a ZIP archive containing:

```
document.sidedoc
├── content.md         # Clean markdown (AI reads/writes this)
├── structure.json     # Block structure and mappings
├── styles.json        # Formatting information per block
├── manifest.json      # Metadata and version info
└── assets/            # Images and embedded files
```

The AI works with `content.md` — pure markdown with no metadata or special markers. The other files preserve formatting information so the original docx can be reconstructed with styling intact.

### The Sync Advantage

Sidedoc's sync capability provides a fundamentally different workflow than traditional document generation:

**Traditional document generation:**
- AI reads document → Generates new content → Creates entirely new .docx
- Problem: All formatting must be specified programmatically or defaults to basic styles
- Result: Original formatting (custom styles, branding, complex layouts) is lost

**Sidedoc sync workflow:**
- AI edits `content.md` → Sync detects changes → Updates .docx intelligently
- **Unchanged blocks:** Keep their original formatting exactly (fonts, colors, spacing)
- **Modified blocks:** Preserve formatting while updating content
- **New blocks:** Receive intelligent defaults based on type (heading styles for headings, etc.)
- **Deleted blocks:** Cleanly removed from output
- Result: Format preservation is automatic, not manual

This means you can maintain a "golden master" document with perfect corporate styling, and AI can update content indefinitely without degrading the formatting.

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Extract: Create sidedoc from docx
sidedoc extract document.docx

# Build: Generate docx from sidedoc
sidedoc build document.sidedoc

# Sync: After editing content.md, update the docx
sidedoc sync document.sidedoc

# Validate: Check sidedoc integrity
sidedoc validate document.sidedoc

# Diff: Show changes between content.md and last synced state
sidedoc diff document.sidedoc

# Info: Display sidedoc metadata
sidedoc info document.sidedoc

# Unpack/Pack: Extract or create sidedoc from directory (debugging)
sidedoc unpack document.sidedoc -o ./unpacked/
sidedoc pack ./unpacked/ -o document.sidedoc
```

---

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. User has a formatted Word document
$ ls
quarterly_report.docx

# 2. Extract to sidedoc for AI processing
$ sidedoc extract quarterly_report.docx
Created: quarterly_report.sidedoc

# 3. AI reads the markdown content efficiently
$ unzip -p quarterly_report.sidedoc content.md
# Quarterly Report
We achieved **strong results** in Q3...

# 4. AI edits content.md (via Claude Code or similar)
# ... AI adds a new section, modifies text ...

# 5. Sync changes back to docx
$ sidedoc sync quarterly_report.sidedoc
Synced: 3 blocks modified, 1 block added

# 6. Rebuild the docx for human consumption
$ sidedoc build quarterly_report.sidedoc -o quarterly_report_updated.docx
Created: quarterly_report_updated.docx

# 7. Open in Word - formatting preserved, content updated
```

## Supported Elements (MVP)

## Track Changes Support

Sidedoc supports bidirectional track changes using [CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com/) syntax:

### CriticMarkup Syntax

| Syntax | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `{++text++}` | Insertion | `{++added text++}` |
| `{--text--}` | Deletion | `{--removed text--}` |
| `{~~old~>new~~}` | Substitution | `{~~old text~>new text~~}` |

### Extraction (docx → sidedoc)

When extracting a Word document with Track Changes:
- Insertions become `{++text++}` in content.md
- Deletions become `{--text--}` in content.md
- Author and date metadata are preserved in structure.json

Use `--track-changes` to force enable or `--no-track-changes` to accept all changes:

```bash
# Auto-detect track changes (default)
sidedoc extract document.docx

# Force extract track changes as CriticMarkup
sidedoc extract document.docx --track-changes

# Accept all changes (ignore track changes)
sidedoc extract document.docx --no-track-changes
```

### Sync (edited content.md → docx)

AI agents can use CriticMarkup in content.md to propose changes:

```markdown
# Before editing
This is a simple document.

# After AI edits
This is a {++very ++}simple document with {--removed--} content.
```

When syncing, CriticMarkup becomes proper Word track changes:
- `{++text++}` → w:ins elements (insertions)
- `{--text--}` → w:del elements (deletions)
- `{~~old~>new~~}` → deletion followed by insertion

Configure the author name for AI-generated changes:

```bash
# Default author: "Sidedoc AI"
sidedoc sync document.sidedoc -o output.docx

# Custom author name
sidedoc sync document.sidedoc -o output.docx --author "Claude AI"
```

### Limitations

- Track changes only apply to text content (not formatting changes)
- Comments are not yet supported
- Move operations are extracted as delete + insert
