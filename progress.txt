- Use python-docx for all docx file operations
- Access hyperlinks via paragraph._element XML (w:hyperlink elements)
- Look up URLs from document.part.rels using relationship IDs
- pytest for testing with fixtures in tests/fixtures/
- All modules should have proper type hints and pass mypy typecheck
- Use dataclasses for models and result types
- Markdown link syntax: [visible text](url)
