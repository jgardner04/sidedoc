# Sidedoc TDD Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Use python-docx for all docx file operations
- pytest for testing with fixtures in tests/fixtures/
- All modules should have proper type hints and pass mypy typecheck
- Use dataclasses for models (defined in models.py)
- Click framework for CLI with proper exit codes (0=success, 1=error, 2=not found, 3=invalid format, 4=sync conflict)
- Block types: heading, paragraph, list, image
- Structure.json maps content.md blocks to docx paragraph indices
